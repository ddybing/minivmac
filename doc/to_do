Here are some possible improvements for future
versions. Which is to say, if anyone wants
to work on these, I'll be happy to include
the changes into Mini vMac.  You're welcome
to add any other features you like, but I
may not include them in Mini vMac, since the
main goal is simplicity. Bug fixes are
always welcome.

-----


* more authentic emulation of keyboard and
mouse. Keyup and keydown events are currently
poked directly into the event queue of the
emulated machine and the the current mouse
location is poked into low memory locations.
This is simple and fast, but inelegant, and causes
compatibility problems with some programs.

* port to windows, linux, etc. Since vMac
has been ported to many platforms, it should
be straight forward to port Mini vMac.

* better understanding of how the ROM starts up
the machine could lead to faster boot times, by
better ROM patches to remove what isn't needed,
such a memory checks, and the startup sound.

--------
Possibly
--------

* add support for sound. The latest version of
vMac/Mac has an initial implementation of sound.
Adding this to vMac would add complexity, but
perhaps could be considered necessary for
a true emulation of the Mac Plus.
