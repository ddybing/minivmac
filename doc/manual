How to use the Mini vMac program.


vMac requires ROM image file from a Mac Plus to run.
The ROM image file can be made with the CopyRom utility,
available from www.vMac.org.  The resulting ROM image
file is copyright Apple Computer, and may not be
redistributed.  (Do not ask me for a copy.)

The rom image file should be named 'vMac.ROM' and
placed in the folder containing Mini vMac.

The emulated floppy drives use 'disk image' files.
The program 'Disk Copy', from Apple, which comes
with Mac OS, can be used to create and edit disk
images.


Menu Commands
-------------

Apple
	About Mini vMac...
		Gives a short message about the program.
		Choose 'OK' to continue.
		
File
	Open Disk Image...
		Brings up the standard dialog to select
		a disk image file to open. This has
		the effect of inserting the emulated
		disk into an emulated floppy drive.
		Mini vMac can have up to three disk
		images mounted at once. Attempting to
		mount more the three will result
		in an error alert.
	Quit
		Quits Mini vMac. Sort of like flipping
		the power switch on the emulated machine.
		The emulated machine should be shut down
		first. Mini vMac will bring up a warning
		OK/Cancel dialog if any disks are still
		mounted (as a substitute for trying
		determine if the machine has been shut
		down).

Special
	Share Time
		Allows other programs to run in the
		background. This is normally off to
		provide the smoothest possible emulation.
		One noticeable side effect of having
		'Share Time' off is that the clock in the
		menu bar doesn't update.
	Limit Speed
		Limits the speed of the emulated machine
		to approximately that of the original
		Mac Plus. This makes some games more
		playable.
	Reset
		The reset button for the emulated Mac
		Plus. All unsaved changes are lost.
		Mini vMac will bring up a warning
		OK/Cancel dialog first.
	Interrupt
		The interrupt button for the emulated
		Mac Plus.  This invokes any installed
		debugger.  However no debugger yet
		works with Mini vMac, because of problems
		with the keyboard and mouse emulation,
		so this isn't very useful yet.
		Mini vMac will bring up a warning
		OK/Cancel dialog first.
