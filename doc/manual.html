<B>MANUAL</B>

<P>

Mini vMac requires a ROM image file from a Mac Plus to run.
The ROM image file can be made with the CopyRom utility,
available from www.vMac.org.  The resulting ROM image
file is copyright Apple Computer, and may not be
redistributed.  (Do not ask me for a copy.)

</P> <P>

Instructions for the 3 versions:

<P>

<B>Macintosh</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

The ROM image file should be named 'vMac.ROM' and
placed in the folder containing Mini vMac.

</P> <P>

The emulated floppy drives use 'disk image' files.
The program 'Disk Copy', from Apple, which comes
with Mac OS, can be used to create and edit disk
images.

	About Mini vMac...
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			Gives a short message about the program.
			Choose 'OK' to continue.

File
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Open Disk Image...
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		Brings up the standard dialog to select
		a disk image file to open. This has
		the effect of inserting the emulated
		disk into an emulated floppy drive.
		Mini vMac can have up to three disk
		images mounted at once. Attempting to
		mount more than three will result
		in an error alert.
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Quit
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		Quits Mini vMac. Sort of like flipping
		the power switch on the emulated machine.
		The emulated machine should be shut down
		first. Mini vMac will bring up a warning
		OK/Cancel dialog if any disks are still
		mounted (as a substitute for trying
		determine if the machine has been shut
		down).
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

Special
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Limit Speed
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		Limits the speed of the emulated machine
		to approximately that of the original
		Mac Plus. This makes some games more
		playable.
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Reset
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The reset button for the emulated Mac
		Plus. All unsaved changes are lost.
		Mini vMac will bring up a warning
		OK/Cancel dialog first.
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Interrupt
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		The interrupt button for the emulated
		Mac Plus.  This invokes any installed
		debugger.
		Mini vMac will bring up a warning
		OK/Cancel dialog first.
		</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Notes:
	<p>
	The emulated clock is set to the current time when Mini vMac
	starts. But it loses time when the emulation isn't running,
	such as when the program isn't the front most application.
	
	<p>
	A disk image file can also be opened by dragging it onto the
	Mini vMac application icon, or the Mini vMac window if the
	program is running. If a disk image file's creator
	is set to 'MnvM' (which can be done with ResEdit), double
	clicking on its icon will open it with Mini vMac. (This works
	more predictably if there is only a single copy of Mini vMac
	on your machine.) If also its
	file type is set to 'MvIm', it will get the vMac disk image
	icon in the Finder.
	
	<p>
	When Mini vMac is first launched, it will look in the folder
	containing the application for disk images named 'disk1.dsk',
	'disk2.dsk', and 'disk3.dsk',
	and open them if found. It stops at the
	first image not found, i.e. if there is no 'disk2.dsk',
	it won't open 'disk3.dsk', even if it exists.

	<p>
	The 'vMac.ROM' file in the folder containing the application
	may be an alias file, pointing to the real ROM file
	elsewhere. The 'disk1.dsk', 'disk2.dsk', and 'disk3.dsk'
	files may be also be aliases.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Microsoft Windows</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mini vMac works on Windows pretty much the same way
	it works on the Macintosh. The about command is in
	the help menu on the right (there is no apple menu).
	The Control key is used to emulate the Macintosh
	Command key, and the Alt key is used to emulate
	the Macintosh Option key.
	
	<p>
	When Mini vMac is run, it registers in the Windows
	Registry '.dsk' files as belonging to Mini vMac,
	so that double clicking on a '.dsk' file will
	open it with Mini vMac. It also registers '.rom'
	files, so that the ROM image file will have an
	icon. This may not be a good idea, if some other
	programs wants to use these extensions. To change this,
	see the code 'RegisterInRegistry()' in 'OSGLUWIN.c'.
	
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>X Window System</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mini vMac on X does not yet have menus and dialogs.
	When launched from the command line with no arguments
	it will look in the current directory for a ROM file named
	'vMac.ROM', and look for a disk image named 'Disk1.DSK'.
	If passed an argument '-r [romfilename]', it will try
	to load the ROM file from [romfilename]. If there are
	any other arguments beginning with '-', it will print out
	copyright and usage information and quit. If there
	are any other arguments, not beginning with '-', it will
	try to mount them as disk image files. (After the program
	starts, there is no way to mount more disk image files.)
	
	<P>
	The F9 key will turn on the Speed Limit option. The
	F10 key will turn it off. The F12 key will cause
	Mini vMac to quit. There is no confirmation alert
	when it quits.
