How to build the Mini vMac program
from the source files:


Building Mini vMac involves compiling all the
C source files and linking the results with
various libraries. The details of compiler
options, linker options, and which libraries
depend on the development environment. To
make this easier, I have included scripts
that figure out these details for two
different development environments:

Building with MPW:
	The Macintosh Programmers Workshop may be
	downloaded free from Apple. see:
		http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/
	MPW has its own scripting language. The
	file 'build' inside the 'mpw' folder is
	such a script. See the comments at the
	beginning of the file on how to use it.
	
Building with Metrowerks CodeWarrior:
	Information about CodeWarrior can be found at
		http://www.metrowerks.com/platforms/mactools/
	CodeWarrior can be scripted with AppleScript.
	For information about AppleScript, see:
		http://www.apple.com/applescript/
	The file 'build' inside the 'mw' folder is
	such a script. It can be opened and run with
	the program 'Script Editor' from Apple, that
	comes with Mac OS. See the comments at the
	beginning of the file on how to use it.
