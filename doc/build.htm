How to build the Mini vMac program
from the source files, for
three supported development environments:

<P>
Building with MPW:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Macintosh Programmers Workshop may be
	downloaded free from Apple. see:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<A href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/">http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/</A>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	MPW has its own scripting language. The
	file 'build' inside the 'tool/mpw' folder is
	such a script. See the comments at the
	beginning of the file on how to use it.

<P>
Building with Metrowerks CodeWarrior:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Information about CodeWarrior can be found at
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<A href="http://www.metrowerks.com/platforms/mactools/">http://www.metrowerks.com/platforms/mactools/</A>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	CodeWarrior can be scripted with AppleScript.
	For information about AppleScript, see:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<A href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/">http://www.apple.com/applescript/</A>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The file 'build' inside the 'tool/mw' folder is
	such a script. It can be opened and run with
	the program 'Script Editor' from Apple, that
	comes with Mac OS. See the comments at the
	beginning of the file on how to use it.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Building with Microsoft Visual C++:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	This needs to be written.  Here are some brief notes
	for the moment:
	<P>
	I don't know how
	to set up a project with a script, so this
	has to be done manually. Copy 'tool/msvc/CNFGGLOB.h'
	into the 'c_src' folder, replacing the existing
	file. Create a new project and add all the c files
	in the 'c_src' folder. Also add the resource file
	'platform/win/main.rc'. The project can now be
	built.
