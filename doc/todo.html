<B>TO DO</B>

<P>


Here are some possible improvements for future
versions. Which is to say, if anyone wants
to work on these, I'll be happy to include
the changes into Mini vMac.  You're welcome
to add any other features you like, but I
may not include them in my version of Mini
vMac, since the main goal is simplicity.
Bug fixes are always welcome.

<UL> <LI>

More authentic emulation of the mouse.
Should emulate the hardware, rather than
poking the current mouse location into
low memory locations of the emulated machine.

</LI> <LI>

the X port should work with Gnome or KDE
if available, to provide menus, alerts,
file dialogs, etc.

</LI> <LI>

better understanding of how the ROM starts up
the machine could lead to faster boot times, by
better ROM patches to remove what isn't needed,
such a memory checks, and the startup sound.
