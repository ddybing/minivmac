How to build the Mini vMac program
from the source files, for
four supported development environments:

<P>
Building with MPW:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Macintosh Programmers Workshop may be
	downloaded free from Apple. see:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<A href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/">http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/</A>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	MPW has its own scripting language. The
	file 'build' inside the 'tool/mpw' folder is
	such a script. See the comments at the
	beginning of the file on how to use it.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Building with Metrowerks CodeWarrior:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Information about CodeWarrior can be found at
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<A href="http://www.metrowerks.com/platforms/mactools/">http://www.metrowerks.com/platforms/mactools/</A>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	CodeWarrior can be scripted with AppleScript.
	For information about AppleScript, see:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<A href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/">http://www.apple.com/applescript/</A>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The file 'build' inside the 'tool/mw' folder is
	such a script. It can be opened and run with
	the program 'Script Editor' from Apple, that
	comes with Mac OS. See the comments at the
	beginning of the file on how to use it.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Building with Microsoft Visual C++:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	I don't know how to script Microsoft Visual C++ to
	automate setting up a project and compiling. The file 'build'
	inside the 'tool/msvc' folder has some instructions
	for doing this manually.
	
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Building with Bash (or similar shell for unix (or similar)):
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bash can be to used run script files. The
	file 'build' inside the 'tool/bash' folder is
	such a script. See the comments at the
	beginning of the file on how to use it.
