Latest News:

<P>

<B> May 29, 2001 </B> version 0.1.3 released. Fixes MPW build
script. Also the default sound level is now set to zero, since
Mini vMac doesn't emulate sound. The main effect is that the
menu bar will flash when a program calls SysBeep, instead
nothing happening at all.

<P>

There is a now an initial Carbon version for Mac OS X, but
I wouldn't recommend using it yet. The non Carbon version
works faster and better both in OS 9 and in Mac OS X.

<P>

<B> March 27, 2001 </B> version 0.1.2 released. Fixes problem
where emulated machine would hang if key pressed at startup
before any disk was inserted. The same fix (checking the event
mask before posting keyboard events) also improves compatibility
with some programs.

<P>

Mini vMac can now read old style disk image files (which
have an 84 bytes header), by using some code from the
Windows version of vMac.  It also uses some code from
Windows vMac for an emulation of SCSI (with no SCSI
devices attached), so that system software will think
its running on a Mac Plus, instead of a 512ke.

<P>

Also new is a bigger and more informative 'about' box,
and numerous source code cleanups.

<P>

<B> March 14, 2001 </B> version 0.1.1 released. Now runs on
Microsoft Windows in addition to Mac OS. Also fixes a problem
in posting keyboard events to the emulated machine.

<P>

<B> February 28, 2001 </B> version 0.1.0 released, the first
public release of Mini vMac.
