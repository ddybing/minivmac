<B>ABOUT</B>

<P>

Mini vMac is a minor spin off of the program
vMac. Its goal is to provide the simplest usable
emulation of a Macintosh, instead of the
fastest or most usable emulation. It can serve
as a programmers introduction to vMac, having
only about one tenth as much source code.

</P> <P>

Mini vMac emulates a Mac Plus, a Macintosh computer
sold between 1986 and 1990. It can be used to run old
software that otherwise couldn't be used on recent
machines. Mini vMac is designed to be portable, and
so fars works on Macintosh OS and Microsoft Windows.
Like vMac, it requires a ROM image file to run, and
so can be legally used only by those who own a Mac
Plus.

</P> <P>

Mini vMac is smaller than vMac because it uses a
much simpler, though slower, emulation of the 68000
processor, and strips out all extra features, such
as printing or saving screen images.
