	"... he was a Professor of Archaeology and Anthropology, and it

	to relive his childhood." <A HREF="#quoteref">*</A>

Mini vMac is a minor spin off of the program
vMac. Its goal is to provide the simplest usable
emulation of a Macintosh, instead of the
fastest or most usable emulation. It can serve
as a programmers introduction to vMac, having
only about one tenth as much source code.

</P> <P>

Mini vMac, like vMac, emulates a Mac Plus, a Macintosh computer
sold between 1986 and 1990. They both can be used to run old
software that otherwise couldn't be used on recent
machines, including nearly all of the earliest Macintosh
software. And so they can help to preserve history, from the
era when the modern user interface for computers was being
defined.

</P> <P>

Mini vMac is designed to be portable, and
so far works on Macintosh OS, Microsoft Windows,
and the X Window System.
Like vMac, it requires a ROM image file to run, and
so can be legally used only by those who own a Mac
Plus.

</P> <P>

Mini vMac is smaller than vMac because it uses a
much simpler, though slower, emulation of the 68000
processor, and strips out all extra features, such
as printing or saving screen images.

(*) Douglas Adams, "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency", pg. 19, 1987.
This quote is especially appropriate because the Author's Note
at the front of the book mentions it was written on a Mac Plus.
And the book incidentally has a good view of the computer industry
of the time. Accurate view or not, it's great fun. Douglas
Adams was involved in the making of a computer game from
his book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
