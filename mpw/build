# This is a script to build the Mini vMac application using
# the Macintosh Programmers Workshop (MPW).  Open this file
# with MPW, choose the 'Select All' command in the Edit menu,
# and click on the box labeled 'MPW Shell' at the top of
# this files window.  You will be asked for the location
# of the minivmac folder.  When the script finishes executing,
# the Mini vMac application should be found in the folder "drv"
# that has been created within the Mini vMac folder.
