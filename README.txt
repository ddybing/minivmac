All documentation is in the 'doc' folder, in
html format. The starting point is 'default.html'.

If by some chance you don't want to use a web browser,
the html code is formatted to be more or less
readable using any text editor.

This documentation is identical to what appears
on the web page "http://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac",
at the time of release. The web page may contain
a newer version.
