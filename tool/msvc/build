Instructions for building Mini vMac for windows
using Microsoft Visual C++ :

----------

Summary:

	Copy 'tool/msvc/CNFGGLOB.h' into the 'c_src' folder,
	replacing the existing file. Create a new project and
	add all the c files in the 'c_src' folder. Also add
	the resource file 'platform/win/main.rc'. The project
	can now be built.

----------

Here are a bit more detailed instruction,
for MSVC version 6:

*) unzip the file "minivmac-0.1.4.src.zip" to get a directory such as "c:\minivmac".

*) copy 'minivmac\tool\msvc\CNFGGLOB.h' into the 'minivmac\c_src' folder, replacing the existing file.

*) launch Microsoft Visual C++

*) choose the 'File>New' menu command ('New' from the 'File' menu).

*) select the 'Projects' tab of the dialog.

*) select 'Win32 Application' from the list.

*) set 'Project name' to 'minivmac'

*) choose a Location for the files generated by MSVC.
I prefer 'c:\minivmac\drv'.

*) click the 'OK' button.

*) select 'An Empty Project' option, and click on the 'Finish' button.

*) choose the 'Project>Add To Project>Files...' menu command.

*) navigate to the 'minivmac\c_src' folder.

*) select Files of type 'C++ Source Files'

*) click on the list of files, and select them all by typing 'Control-A'.

*) click the 'OK' button.

*) choose the 'Project>Add To Project>Files...' menu command again.

*) navigate to the 'minivmac\platform\win' folder.

*) click on 'main.rc'

*) click the 'OK' button.

*) choose the 'Build>Build minivmac.exe' menu command.

*) if it works, the debug version of minivmac will be
created, and put someplace such as
'c:\minivmac\drv\Debug\minivmac.exe'.

*) place a copy of the macintosh plus rom, named
'vMac.ROM', into the same directy as minivmac.exe

*) minivmac.exe should now be useable.
