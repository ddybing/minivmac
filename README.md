# Mini vMac - Emulator edition

This will evolve into a "custom" edition of Mini vMac that I am going to use in a Macintosh Classic clone using a Raspberry Pi.
All credits for the original source goes towards Paul C. Pratt. You can check out the Mini vMac project at https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/

Won't be any fancy or complex additions. 

Some things that I want to implement into the emulator:

* Detect when a floppy is inserted into a real floppy drive (probably USB floppy), and mount it automatically.
* Detect when the mounted floppy is ejected from inside the emulator, and eject the floppy physically (if supported by the drive)
