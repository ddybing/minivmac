Mini vMac is based upon Richard F. Bannister's
Macintosh port of vMac. see:
	http://www.bannister.org/software/

vMac was written by Philip Cummins and others.
Please see this credits page:

The vMac home page is:

The core cpu emulation code of vMac was adapted
from the UAE Amiga Emulator by Bernd Schmidt. see:
	http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~uae/
	
Mini vMac is extensively modified from vMac, so
I should take blame for any bugs I've introduced.
